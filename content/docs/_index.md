Welcome to the hx documentation. **hx** is an extremely fast Haskell package and project manager, written in Rust.

## What is hx?

hx is a modern toolchain CLI for Haskell that makes working with Haskell projects simple and fast. It wraps existing Haskell tools (GHC, Cabal, GHCup, HLS) in a unified, ergonomic interface with:

- **Fast feedback loops** — Common workflows are optimized for speed
- **Deterministic builds** — Lockfile support ensures reproducible builds
- **Excellent error messages** — Actionable diagnostics with suggested fixes
- **Batteries included** — Format, lint, test, and document out of the box
- **Multiple compiler backends** — Support for both GHC and BHC
